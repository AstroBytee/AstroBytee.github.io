            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p>
                Arngren is a  online marketplace that sells a wide variety of products, 
                including electronics, toys, tools, and household items. The website is 
                known for its cluttered and overwhelming design, which can make it difficult 
                for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast: </b>Arngren has over 312 contrast errors according to Wave. It has bright text with a bright background making it difficult to read.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition: </b>The website lacks consistency in its design, with different fonts, colors, and layouts used throughout the site.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment: </b>The website has a chaotic layout, with elements placed haphazardly on the page.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b>Related items are not grouped together, making it difficult for users to find what they are looking for. It is very cluttered and overwhelming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, Arngren is an example of a website that doesn't meet the CRAP principles and could benefit from a 
                complete redesign to improve its usability and visual appeal.
