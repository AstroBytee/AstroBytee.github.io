            <p>&emsp;Six young Army pilots and green officers, all between 20 and 21 years old, arrive in Vietnam where they each become men, highly skilled pilots, and proficient officers within a few months. None of them will be the same after their first combat tour in Vietnam.</p>

                    <p><b>Kim Catanzarite, Freelance Editor, Accomplished Writer, and Writers Digest Instructor wrote in her FIVE-STAR REVIEW in 2015.</b>“We follow Larry and his fellow birdmen into the treacherous Vietnam landscape, hoping for their safety and amazed by their skill and bravery. These are brutally honest stories about the young men who flew 24/7 into dangerous situations and helped save many lives. You won't soon forget them. The narratives and descriptions are wonderful—very real and powerful. Blades of Thunder (Book 1) is literally edge-of-your-seat reading. I also have enjoyed learning about the other "characters" in the book; that is, the guys Larry went to flight school with and all who play a part in his experiences. I find myself frequently thinking about the book. It is very moving and very real, and simply heartbreaking at times. The character arc from new soldier to seasoned warrior is right on target. It should be made into a movie or mini-series!”</p>

                    <p><b>Major General (Ret) James Livingston, USMC, Medal of Honor Recipient wrote:</b> “An action-packed, fact-filled, and provocative story about some of the bravest of the bravest in Vietnam ---- our helicopter pilots, crew chiefs, and door gunners! This book is filled with many valuable lessons and helpful advice that today's US military services, troops, the Veterans Administration, and civilian leaders should read and remember.”</p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Author Godfrey Garner, PhD, on August 1, 2020</b>“They didn't plan on it when they left home, little more than high school kids, but men who fought in Vietnam quickly became the bravest of the brave, and many will attest to the fact that among these, the bravest were the Huey pilots and crew. The warfighters who survived that bloody event will to a man, recount at least one, and often multiple times they were literally plucked from certain death by a Huey pilot and his crew. Larry Dandridge, in writing Blades of Thunder, has very eloquently and descriptively brought many of these actions to the reader. In his work, the reader can almost smell and feel the atmosphere in Vietnam. Larry has done a great service to Huey pilots and crew and their families by telling their story in such a simple, yet profound way. Blades of Thunder is a must-read, especially in a time when so much of our history is being stripped from us."</p>
