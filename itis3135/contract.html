        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
            I, <a href="introduction.html">Ryan M. LaCroix</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
            2025, ITIS 3135, Front-End Web Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available 
            to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, 
            or that I wish to keep private. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
            not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many 
            examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these 
            resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. 
        </p>
        <p>
