            <h2>What are Tabletop Games?</h2>
            <p>Tabletop games encompass a wide variety of experiences that can be enjoyed on any flat surface, typically a table. These include classic board games like chess and Monopoly, strategic card games such as Magic: The Gathering, and even miniature-based war games like Warhammer. The genre is incredibly diverse, offering something for every type of player—from casual family fun to intense competitive play.</p>
            <p>Historically, tabletop games have been a cornerstone of social interaction across cultures. Ancient civilizations played games like Senet in Egypt or Go in China, and today's modern games build on that legacy with innovative mechanics and storytelling. With hundreds of titles available, each game brings its own unique rules, themes, and strategies, making the world of tabletop gaming endlessly rich and rewarding.</p>
            <p>Some genres of tabletop games are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Board Games</li>
                <li>Role-playing</li>
                <li>Stategy</li>
                <li>Dice</li>
                <li>Deck Building</li>
                <li>Engine Builders</li>

            <h3>The Guild</h3>
            <p>The Guild is a vibrant and welcoming student organization at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, dedicated to the joy of gaming in all its forms. Every Friday, members gather to explore a wide range of tabletop experiences—from classic board games and card games to role-playing adventures and indie titles. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a curious newcomer, there's always something new to discover.</p>
            <p>One of the best aspects of The Guild is its open format. You're encouraged to join in on any game already being played, or bring your own favorite game to share with others. Hosting your own session is easy and supported by the community, making it a great place to test new games or introduce friends to your personal favorites.

            <h2>When Can I Play?</h2>
            <p>One of the greatest joys of tabletop gaming is its flexibility—you can play anytime, anywhere, and with anyone. Whether it's a cozy winter evening indoors or a sunny afternoon at the park, tabletop games adapt to your schedule and setting. There's no seasonal limit or required setup beyond a flat surface and a few willing participants.</p>
            <p>Late-night game sessions are especially memorable. You can gather with friends and play until the early hours, laughing over dice rolls and dramatic plot twists. Tabletop games offer a timeless escape from screens and stress, making them perfect for spontaneous fun or planned game nights. The freedom to play year-round means the adventure never has to end.</p>

            <h2>Where Can I Play?</h2>
            <p>Tabletop games are incredibly versatile when it comes to location. You can play them in your living room, at a coffee shop, in a dorm lounge, or even outdoors on a picnic table. All you need is a reasonably flat surface and enough space to accommodate the components of the game. Some games are compact and travel-friendly, making them ideal for road trips or quick play sessions on the go.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some games—especially those with miniatures, elaborate boards, or multiple decks—require a larger setup. These games are best enjoyed on spacious tables where players can spread out and immerse themselves fully. Whether you're in a cramped apartment or a dedicated game room, there's a tabletop game that fits your space and style.</p>
